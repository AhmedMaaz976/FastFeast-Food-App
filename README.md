# 🍽️ FastFeast – Online Food Ordering Platform

FastFeast is a **MERN stack** based responsive web application developed for a local café in a rural village to modernize their food ordering process. This platform allows customers to browse the café’s menu, place orders, and track their order status in real-time via desktop or mobile devices.

## 📌 Project Overview

FastFeast was initiated to help a small rural café reach more customers and manage operations efficiently. It integrates modern web technologies to create a seamless ordering experience for both customers and administrators.

I built this web application together with my fellow developer **Umar Ijaiz** as a collaborative project aimed at supporting local businesses with digital tools.
